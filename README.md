sprits-it! â€” Awesome Speed-Reading
==================================

`sprits-it!` is an open source web application which allows speed-reading of arbitrary web pages in a browser.

The speed reading technique is currently based on the ideas of [Spritz](http://www.spritzinc.com/) described in their [blog](http://www.spritzinc.com/blog). At the time of this writing [Spritz](http://www.spritzinc.com/) had virtually nothing to offer to `iOs` device users to play with :confused:. So this project is targeted specifically on usability in mobile Safari and Chrome on `iOs`, yet the chances are it would work in other browsers as well.

To read a web page at ``page_url`` use the following API:
```
http://the-happy-hippo.github.io/sprits-it/read/?url=page_url
```

For example:

> http://the-happy-hippo.github.io/sprits-it/read/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.spritzinc.com%2Fthe-science

Alternatively, you migh just grab a _bookmarklet_ at the bottom of the page at http://the-happy-hippo.github.io/sprits-it/read.

The bootstrap code was imported from a [CodePen](http://codepen.io) snippet at http://codepen.io/the-happy-hippo/pen/aDHrl which in turn had been forked from a great Pen by [Charlotte Dann](http://codepen.io/pouretrebelle) at http://codepen.io/pouretrebelle/pen/reGKw with javascript cherrypicking for [Readability](https://www.readability.com) text extraction from [OpenSpritz](https://github.com/Miserlou/OpenSpritz) project by [Rich Jones](https://github.com/Miserlou)(@miserlou).

Here is the description from [Charlotte Dann](http://codepen.io/pouretrebelle) for her original [Pen](http://codepen.io/pouretrebelle/pen/reGKw):
> Use [Spritz](http://www.spritzinc.com/) right now! Options for speed, localStorage saving, jog forward/backward, text size and dark/light theme, also with keyboard controls and progress bar. You'll never need to read conventionally again.
