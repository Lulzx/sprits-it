sprits-it! â€” Awesome Speed-Reading
==================================

`sprits-it!` is an open source web application which allows speed-reading of arbitrary web pages in a browser.

The speed reading technique is currently based on the ideas of [Spritz](http://www.spritzinc.com/) described in their [blog](http://www.spritzinc.com/blog). At the time of this writing [Spritz](http://www.spritzinc.com/) had virtually nothing to offer to [iOs](http://www.apple.com/ios) device users to play with. This project is targeted specifically on usability in Safari and Chrome mobile browsers but should ultimately work well on other platforms.

## Demo

Live demo is hosted at [Google App Engine](http://cloud.google.com/products/app-engine) here:

> http://spritsit.appspot.com/read

To read a web page at ``page_url`` use the following GET query:
`http://spritsit.appspot.com/read?url=page_url`

For example:

> http://spritsit.appspot.com/read?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.spritzinc.com%2Fthe-science

Alternatively, you migh just grab a _bookmarklet_ in the settings section of the demo.

## Contributors

The bootstrap code was imported from a [CodePen](http://codepen.io) snippet at http://codepen.io/the-happy-hippo/pen/aDHrl which in turn had been forked from a great Pen by [Charlotte Dann](http://codepen.io/pouretrebelle) at http://codepen.io/pouretrebelle/pen/reGKw with javascript cherrypicking for [Readability](https://www.readability.com) text extraction from [OpenSpritz](https://github.com/Miserlou/OpenSpritz) project by [Rich Jones](https://github.com/Miserlou)(@miserlou).

Up-to-date Gist from codepen can be found at https://gist.github.com/the-happy-hippo/9474002.

Here is the description from [Charlotte Dann](http://codepen.io/pouretrebelle) for her original [Pen](http://codepen.io/pouretrebelle/pen/reGKw):
> Use [Spritz](http://www.spritzinc.com/) right now! Options for speed, localStorage saving, jog forward/backward, text size and dark/light theme, also with keyboard controls and progress bar. You'll never need to read conventionally again. 
> localStorage implementation by [Keith Wyland](http://codepen.io/keithwyland/), thanks Keith!

### Notice to Contributors

I have started this project purely for educational purposes while having virtually no prior background in web design (apart from plain old HTML tables of 90's).

If you find something stupid that I did &mdash; please don't blame me and never hesitate to point those things out so I can learn from them.
